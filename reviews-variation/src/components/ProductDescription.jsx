  <h3>Made for Indian Taste Buds</h3>

  <p>
    Maska Chatpata Peanut Butter is crafted using carefully selected, premium
    roasted peanuts combined with a bold and balanced blend of Indian spices.
    The result is a distinctive chatpata flavour that delivers a tangy and
    mildly spicy experience with every spoon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike conventional peanut butters that focus only on sweetness, this
    variant is designed to complement Indian food preferences. It pairs well
    with everyday meals, snacks, and recipes, while still maintaining a clean
    nutritional profile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each batch is prepared with a focus on quality and consistency. The peanuts
    are roasted to achieve a rich aroma and smooth texture, ensuring that the
    flavour remains balanced without overpowering the natural taste of peanuts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maska Chatpata Peanut Butter is high in protein and healthy fats, making it a
    suitable choice for active lifestyles. It contains no trans fats, no palm
    oil, and no unnecessary additives, keeping the ingredient list simple and
    transparent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether enjoyed on toast, blended into smoothies, or used as a flavourful
    ingredient in savoury dishes, Maska Chatpata Peanut Butter is designed to
    deliver taste and nutrition in every serving.
